# Rosalind problem exercises

A co-worker showed me the Rosalind site, https://rosalind.info/problems/tree-view/, that collects together problems for learning bioinformatics.

This seems like a good idea, so I'm collecting together my exercises here and posting as [@prepend](https://rosalind.info/users/prepend/).

This might be overkill, but I didn't see a way that the site kept track of my assignments so figured I will stick them here.

## Structure

- [exercises](./exercises/) - one python file for each script
- [data/in](./data/in/) - input files from rosalind.info
- [data/out](./data/out/) - output files generated, submitted as solutions to rosalind
